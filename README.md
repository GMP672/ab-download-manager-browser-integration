## How To Build
In order to build this extension locally:
> I am developing this on `Windows` using `npm`, but it should have the same result on other build environments.

npm i

# for firefox
npm run pack:firefox
# for chrome
npm run pack:chrome
```

The output zip file containing the extension will be placed at `./dist/<browser_name>.zip`.
